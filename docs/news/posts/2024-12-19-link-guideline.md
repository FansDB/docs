Added a new guideline for Performers and Studios under links section. It's worded in a way that it's strongly recommended, but is not reason enough to reject submission over it. 

> Avoid adding shortened links. If shortened URL redirects to a full link, use that instead.

- [https://docs.fansdb.cc/performers/#links](https://docs.fansdb.cc/performers/#links)
- [https://docs.fansdb.cc/studios/#links](https://docs.fansdb.cc/studios/#links)

Reasoning for it is simple:

- It leads to duplicate links. Very common case with links scraped from StashDB.
- Another case is that sometimes it excludes valuable information. E.g. ManyVids shortened links doesn't include performer ID, which can be used to lookup details even from defunct performers.

Also, [https://docs.fansdb.cc/performers/#couple-type-accounts](https://docs.fansdb.cc/performers/#couple-type-accounts) guideline was also re-worded to make it clearer without changing it's meaning.
