After some internal discussions, we decided to expand the scope of approved platforms on FansDB. This would extend to pay-per-view (PPV) content of already approved platforms that was previously not allowed. 

<!-- more -->

New requirements for platforms are:

1. Have to perform age verification before allowing creators to post any content.
2. Have to be creator focused and not a mainstream porn studio.
3. Have to be focused on original content.
4. Does not offer free videos of unverified users or clips from mainstream porn studios.

We hope this change will solve several issues:

- Expand the pool of performers that can be added.
- Make deciding if content fits on FansDB more user-friendly.
- Make checking and voting easier and save precious time.

This will lead to increased overlap with StashDB, but their structure of amateur studios is very different from ours (they place all content from the amateur performer under a single studio, no matter the platform it came from) so we think it's a benefit overall. 

As of now, these changes remove all content restrictions from all existing approved platforms Fancentro, JustForFans, LoyalFans and ManyVids (except for animated, drawn, 2D and 3D content) and add new platforms CamSoda, Chaturbate, MFC Share.
