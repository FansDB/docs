We updated to the new version of stash-box, which brings some great new features.

1. Native notifications - you can access them from the :fontawesome-regular-bell: icon next to your username.
2. URL search - you can now search for performers/scenes by URL.
3. Performer draft URLs - URLs matching a valid site will now be automatically added to the links tab.
4. Edit updates - they are no longer limited to one. Each update now will reset present votes. This should help with situations where an edit gets stuck due to a single blocking vote after being fixed.
5. Existing performer check - when submitting a new performer you will be notified if the matching performer already exists based on name/URL.
6. Fingerprints list - All your fingerprints are now available in the list. You can access it by heading to your profile and clicking on My Fingerprints.
7. Current age - on the performer page the age will be displayed next to the year now.
8. Death date - a new field for the death date was added to the performer page.
9. Production date - a new field for the production date was added to the scene page. *Pending formal guideline.*
10. Studio aliases - a new field for studio aliases was added to the studio page. *Pending formal guideline.*
11. New hair color - white hair color option was added.
