After some internal discussions and a non-binding [public poll](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/zOFbyYyRd+vD6zAq7r9QEBmP6wpbHUL9LTNw4G4yFTI/){target=_blank} where majority of people voted in favor of allowing only pay-per-view (PPV) platforms, we decided to expand the scope of approved platforms on FansDB once again.

<!-- more -->

Until now we allowed platforms that have subscription based distribution model or subscription + something else (e.g. ManyVids is primarily pay-per-view (PPV) site, but they do offer subscription based content with their Clubs feature). 

As of now we are removing the content distribution model from the consideration. Be it subscription, pay-per-view (PPV), cam recording or something else it will be allowed if it passes remaining requirements. We know that the metadata available differs depending on the distribution model, so while we are keeping the minimum submission requirements the same, we hope that if more metadata is available it gets added. 

Requirements for platforms to be approved are:

1. Have to perform age verification before allowing creators to post any content.
2. Have to be individual creator focused. 
    1. The creator is the primary producer and participant in the content. 
    2. Not produced by a professional porn studio. 
    3. Features real life people, not drawn, animated, rendered or generated. 
3. Have to be focused on original content.
4. Does not offer clips or full scenes from professional porn studios.
