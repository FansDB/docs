In light of the recent addition of link lookup support in stash-box, as well as a recent poll on our Discord server and the subsequent discussion, we are implementing a significant change to our guidelines.

Previously, we encouraged and permitted the addition of any relevant aliases to a performer's profile. While this approach was beneficial for performer discovery, it incurred a substantial time cost while offering limited value to most users.

As a result, we are revising the naming structure guidelines to limit aliases to usernames from approved networks or professional adult credits.

The updated guidelines are as follows:

## Primary name & aliases

1. Use `FirstName LastName` as the primary name, or fall back to the unique username from the approved network.
1. Include usernames as aliases of added performer accounts from approved networks.
1. Names from professional adult credits can be added as aliases.
1. Social media accounts can be used to verify other names associated with the adult work. Must be properly documented in the comments.
1. Do not add social media or other non-network usernames as aliases.
1. Do not add legal names unless they were used as an adult credit.
1. Properly source each name and alias. Either by submitted links or in the comments.
1. Name and alias fields are case-insensitive; do not add different capitalization variations.
