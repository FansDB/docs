We have a specific structure and guidelines around how we store the metadata on FansDB. Some aspects might seem unnecessary or repetitive, but we do so to keep uniformity across a wide range of different sites.

So please take a moment and read through the guidelines if you plan on contributing. It will save you and us a lot of time and frustration in the future.
