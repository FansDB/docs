## Titles

<div class="annotate" markdown>

3.  Some sources can have titles span multiple lines. This is not shown in the `Details` tab, but the fully rendered title is visible in the `Confirm` tab. 

## Dates

1. Valid date formats are `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY`.
1. In cases where the scene was released multiple times, the earliest known date should be used.
